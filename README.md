It's more than just a simple collection of erotic images; it's a carefully curated experience with a focus on visual storytelling, dynamic interactions, and a surprising amount of emergent gameplay.

## Key Features

*   **Diverse Image Packs:**  The core of Jenny Mod consists of several image packs, each offering a unique and engaging aesthetic. These packs are:
    *   **Sunrise & Sunset:**  Classic and visually stunning, these packs feature beautiful sunsets and sunrises, perfect for romantic moments and exploring new horizons.
    *   **Night Bloom:** A breathtaking collection of nocturnal images, showcasing the beauty of the night and its flora and fauna.
    *   **Hidden Pools:**  A collection of deep, mysterious pools perfect for stealthy encounters and exploring underground caverns.
    *   **Forest Glow:**  Immersive images of forests illuminated by glowing flora and fauna.
    *   **Beach Dreams:**  A collection of beautiful beach scenes, ideal for romantic encounters and relaxing afternoons.
*   **Dynamic Interactions:**  This is where Jenny Mod truly shines!  Several features introduce dynamic interactions based on image placement:
    *   **Sunset Echoes:**  When a sunset image is placed, a subtle shimmering effect appears on the surrounding terrain, creating a visual "echo" of the sunset.  This is a key gameplay element encouraging exploration.
    *   **Night Bloom Pulse:**  When a night bloom image is placed, a pulsing, glowing effect is applied to the ground, triggering a gentle, rhythmic sound effect.
    *   **Forest Bloom Trails:**  When a forest glow image is placed, faint, shimmering trails appear along the terrain, encouraging players to explore the foliage.
    *   **Beach Reflections:**  When a beach image is placed, a subtle ripple effect appears on the water, mimicking the reflections of the beach.
*   **Customizable Blocks:**  We've introduced a new set of blocks, "Dream Blocks," that can be placed in specific locations to enhance the visual experience.  These blocks are:
    *   **Moon Blocks:**  Placed in the center of a clearing, they glow softly at night.
    *   **Sun Blocks:**  Placed on the top of a hill, they cast a warm, golden glow.
    *   **Flower Blocks:**  Placed in a garden, they bloom with flowers and provide a beautiful, natural backdrop.
*   **Sound Effects:** Each image pack has associated sound effects, enhancing the atmosphere.  These are subtle and atmospheric, adding to the immersion.
*   **Mod Compatibility:**  Designed to work seamlessly with all versions of Minecraft (Java Edition, Bedrock Edition).
